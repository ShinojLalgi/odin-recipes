    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, made in very wide, flat sheets. In Italian cuisine it is made
        of stacked layers of pasta alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel
        sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices.</p>

    <p>The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which melts during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with
        the other ingredients and then baked in an oven (al forno). The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving
        square or rectangular portions.</p>
